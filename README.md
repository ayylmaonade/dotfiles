These configuration files are used to tweak existing .confs for software such as kitty, SDDM, PulseAudio & more. 

**IMPORTANT: BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL .conf FILES BEFORE USING MINE. IF YOU DO NOT BACKUP, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ORIGINAL .conf PERMANENTLY.**

Installation;
1. Go to ~/.config
2. Locate the name of the program you'd like to use my .conf with
3. Overwrite your original .conf with mine 
4. Ta-da! 

ISSUES:
Due to some software being rather "random" with where it chooses to place .conf files, you may not find the .conf for a program in ./config. If this is the case, simply open terminal and run **whereis programname** e.g. whereis kitty -- this will show you the path(s) to find the .conf location.
